# Ignoreplayer
The most efficient message filter addon of Vanilla.

Command: /ignoreplayer

This addon filters all the messages by the key words you add.

You can type /ignoreplayer in game to add any key words involved in gold selling or anything else you dont wanna see.


I've collected some key words when i played on this vanilla server.

If you check "Name" option it will only match key words with player's name instead of their messages.

I gotta remind you that they would change content of advertisements sometimes,so make sure to update the key words yourself once their ads appear again.
